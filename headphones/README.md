# ALX Frontend Project - Webpage from Scratch.
## Project overview
The goal of the project is to create a fully functional and responsive webpage from scratch using HTML, CSS, and all the web development techniques. The page must be identical to the provided Figma design without using external libraries, frameworks (such as Bootstrap), or JavaScript. The implementation of the project will rely solely on vanilla HTML and CSS to implement features like responsiveness, hover effects, animations, and accessibility.
## Designer
The webpage design has been created by Nicolas Philippot, a UI/UX designer. All design resources and the Figma file can be found, here is the link to figma design: "https://www.figma.com/design/TwFqqWGYvNYvxZxhdWXv4H/Holberton-School---Headphone-company?node-id=0-2&node-type=frame&t=rYhTL2PItkzvIvUf-0"
## Requirements.
- No external CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind).
- No JavaScript usage.
- Fully responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

- 1-index.html.
- 1-styles.css.
### Task 3: "Our Results" Section.
For the "Our Results" section:
